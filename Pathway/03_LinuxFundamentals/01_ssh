While the most common usage of a regular operating system is graphical(allowing you to see pictures, web browsers, file managers etc.) SSH works through a command line.

The syntax on how to use this command is ssh <user>@<host>. So to ssh into the machine you'll need to type in ssh shiba1@MACHINE_IP. It will prompt you for the user password.

Now that you've logged into the server, you're gonna wanna do things, and everything that can be done over SSH is done by running commands. To start out, we'll take a look at some of the basic commands, and the first command will be echo. Type echo hello, and press enter and you'll see your input echoed back at you.
