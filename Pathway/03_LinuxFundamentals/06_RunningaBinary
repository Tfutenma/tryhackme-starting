Occasionally there will be times when you want to run downloaded or user created programs. This is done by providing the full path to the binary, for example say you download a binary that outputs noot, providing the full path to that binary will execute it. 

Note: A binary is just executable code, think a windows exe file

This seems like a good time to mention Relative Paths! Every time you intend on running the binary, you don't need to provide a full path, you can use Relative Paths.

These shortcuts are incredibly efficient, and save time. These shortcuts for every command, so if I were to run ls . it would be the same as running ls <current directory>
